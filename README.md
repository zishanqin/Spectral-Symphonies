## Project Overview

In this paper, we propose a Mandarin speaker recognition system that utilises spectral features, including Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Delta-Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (DMFCC) and Filter Bank Coefficients (FBC). We employ a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), conditioned on known speaker labels, for the speaker classification. We evaluated our proposed system using the THCHS-30 dataset, a labelled Mandarin audio dataset. The results of our evaluation are promising, demonstrating the systemâ€™s ability to identify and distinguish speakers both within and outside the domain.

## Installation

1.  Create a Conda Virtual Environment (named *SS*) & activate the Virtual Environment:
```
conda create -n SS python=3.9.10
conda activate SS
```
2.  Install required packages:
```
pip install numpy scipy tensorflow==2.10.1 keras==2.10.0 tqdm sklearn matplotlib pandas
```

## Implementation

We provide the pre-processing code for users to use directly:

In our project, we support two different running modes, including **train** and **test**. Some example command-line instructions are provided below.

### Train from scratch
```
python main.py --mode train --load-npz-dir .
```

### Train with loaded model
For example, if we load model from `saved_models` at epoch 18000:
```
python main.py --mode train --load-npz-dir . --load-ckpt saved_models --ckpt_epoch 18000
```

### Train with incomplete features
For example, if we use DMCC + MFCC:
```
python main.py --mode train --load-npz-dir . --selected-features DMFCC MFCC
```

### Test with loaded model
```
python main.py --mode test --load-npz-dir . -load-ckpt saved_models
```

In addition to those, we also have the following setups.

## Features

In our paper, the experiments in Section 4.2 were conducted by setting different 
`--L-reduced-dim` {26,52,78,104,208,312},  `--F-reduced-dim` {3,6,9,12,15,18} to test different dimensionality reduction experiments; experiments in Section 4.3 were conducted by changing different combination for the `--selected-features` {MFCC, DMFCC, FBC, MFCC DMFCC, MFCC FBC, DMFCC FBC, MFCC DMFCC, FBC} arguments.
